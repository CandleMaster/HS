What is an Agatonomy? :

It is an economy guided by a virtuous mindset (‘agathos’ = greek for ‘virtue’). A virtuous mindset encompasses self-benefit with avoiding harm to others, or even benefiting them. It also means considering both short-term and long-term consequences when making decisions. 
A new virtuous economy, i.e an Agatonomy, is created when businesses and consumers that are driven by this mindset exchange value.


Businesses in Agatonomy - Impact brands :

In an Agatonomy, businesses stay true to this principle by giving up some of their self-benefit, like profit, to create benefit for others. This is usually achieved by pursuing an ambitious mission that is fixing a major, pressing issue and is restoring the integrity of damaged systems, be it societal or environmental. In addition, companies operate sustainably and ethically, while creating safe, high quality products for their customers. This way, the exchange of value - think, a customer giving money to receive a product, is not based on a benefit at someone else’s expense/harm, but on mutual value creation. Namely, the business is creating value for both the consumer and the larger mission, made possible through the consumer’s purchasing choice. Therefore, we call such businesses impact brands.

Such a mindset allows for a better way of doing business, a better culture of commerce that we believe has the potential to change the world for the better. 

Consumers in Agatonomy - Impact co-creators :

Conscious consumers are absolutely essential for an Agatonomy to even come into existence. What would any business be without their customers!? It would frankly not exist! Therefore, consumers, like you, play a pivotal role in an Agatonomy, as they do in any other system of value exchange. Consumers are the ‘demand’ part of the law of demand and supply which drives the whole machine of the economy. 

We personally think that a conscious consumer is both the smartest and the happiest. It’s so important to know what you consume on a daily basis and how it affects you and the rest of the world as we all are so tightly interconnected. We can’t outsource full responsibility for our well-being onto the government (regulations) and companies (r&d/innovation) alone, but must ourselves do ‘the homework’ on what becomes part of our lives. 
And why are you the happiest? Simply because it feels so incredibly good knowing that the product you bought leads to improvement of someone else’s life, and you are part of it. For this reason, we also call you an ‘impact co-creator’, because you are the other half of Agatonomy’s equation. 


What exactly is the difference between an impact brand and a sustainable company?


Impact brands are sustainable companies plus. 

A sustainable business is one that “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs’’ (iisd.org). A sustainable business must not deplete natural resources or harm human wellbeing. But, ‘not doing harm’ is different to ‘doing good’! This is exactly where the difference lies. Impact brands not only have a ‘harm-less’ business model, but they voluntarily take on extra responsibility to create a positive impact, to tackle the world’s critical problems. In real life, this may look like BRONCA’s effort to ameliorate child hunger by donating 50% of their profit from their beautiful handmade ponchos, or like Allmatters’s waste-reducing menstrual cup that supports period education and empowerment of women in developing countries who are still being stigmatized and oppressed in their communities for the most natural and life-baring occurrence of menstruation.

Impact brands’ business models revolve around triple impact: positive impact on the society and nature (public benefit creation) and positive impact on the consumer (superior private goods). We found that companies often produce eco-friendly products that have inferior performance compared to the non-sustainable alternatives, lower quality and premium pricing. We believe that consumer products need to provide sustainable value to consumers, just like to the global society and to the environment. 


In summary, companies in Agatonomy, aka impact brands:

1. Have a big mission. 
The mission is usually targeted at fixing the most pressing global issues that exist for both society and environment. For example, hunger, poverty, species extinction, health, pollution or oppression (similar to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals).

2. Balance profit and mission. 
They balance selling consumer products/services with pursuing an important cause. This leads to the creation of public benefit, which traditionally is the role of governmental institutions. One of our favourite new corporate structures that turned such an approach into law is the Public Benefit Corporation.

3. Sell high quality high-performing products.
They produce high quality high-performing products that are of a great value to consumers and priced fairly. This is similar to some traditional for-profit companies, but different to charities. Consumer health both short- and long-term is one of the main focuses. 




How does Agatonomy differ from the Sustainable Development Goals/Sustainability? 
Do we need a new term?

The goals and principles that drive both Agatonomy and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are very similar: changing economic incentives to create a sustainable well-being both for people and nature in the short and long term. The SDG, outlined by the United Nations, is a top-down approach to solving these issues, as it is driven by the governmental and regulatory bodies. 
Agatonomy, on the other hand, is a bottom-up approach, coming from consumers and the private sector. Specifically, a private sector where impact brands pursue their stated missions with the highest levels of accountability and continuously innovate and scale their impact faster than nonprofits and charities could. Moreover, they ‘‘self-regulate” as they try to eliminate  harmful externalities of production and consumption straight into their design process, compliant with principles of the Circular Economy. Their high degree of accountability which they demonstrate through regular transparent reporting also allows customers to see first-hand how their money is being spent towards the stated impact. 

Having a new term allows us to differentiate between two different approaches that are aiming towards the same goal.



Isn’t it the governments’ role to look after the ‘common good’?

In a traditional sense, yes. We pay taxes to the government and the government then allocates it towards different causes/domains. However, when you pay taxes you have no say in how you want your money to be allocated. For example, you might want 30% of your tax money to go to funding education, 15% for local infrastructure development and 55% to tackle air pollution, because, let’s say, it has been affecting your health lately. Then perhaps you would like to see how progress is being made on these issues? With traditional governments, you don’t have that say, and you don’t get that progress report. You vote for one leader once, and this should represent your values for years to come. With impact brands, you see more transparently how your money is being used towards the stated cause. They voluntarily take on a different level of responsibility for looking after the Common Good and reporting on how much of it is achieved, and how. 

In addition, impact brands are for-profit companies and are therefore ‘forced’ to innovate. This is not just to satisfy the customer with a superior product/service but also to find the most effective ways to make progress towards their stated mission. This is even a legal requirement for Public Benefit Corporationss and a condition to certify as a B corporation  by B-labs. 




Why don’t you simply support charities? Aren’t they taking care of such issues?


There is a need for all different types of business models. However, we believe that the most effective way to make progress fast and efficiently lies in the combination of having resources for one’s own growth (profit) and a meaningful cause (mission). For-profit companies can scale fast but often tend to lose focus on their initial mission and end up just staying in the business for money. Charities and NFPs pursue important causes but due to lack of resources have difficulties scaling and expanding the reach of their impact. We love the idea of balance (after all, that’s why we chose to base our name on the game hopscotch!). And the balance of focusing on both profit and mission is what we think can allow business to act as a powerful force for good.
