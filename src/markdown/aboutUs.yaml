  <h2>Why Hopskotch?</h2>
  <p>Hopskotch LLC was formed in October 2020 with the aim to inspire a new ethical culture of commerce, i.e. Agatonomy.</p>
  <p>When playing the game hopscotch, one needs good aim and good balance to hop forward. This idea of a balanced ‘foundation’ as a necessity to progress forward was an ‘aha’ moment for us. </p>
  <p>A foundation for a more ethical way of doing commerce should balance interests of nature and people both now and in the future.</p>
  <h2>How do we see our role in this?</h2>
  <p>We believe that ethical brands and consumers can turn the economy into a powerful force for good. And we believe that they can do so faster and more effectively than many governments. </p>
  <p> For this reason, our platform has a dual purpose: to promote existing ethical brands (impact brands) and empower consumers with information that will help them make better purchasing and lifestyle choices - choices that will benefit them personally, the environment and the global society. </p>
