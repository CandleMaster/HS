  about: |
    <p>'Go with your flow. Period.' It may sound like a pun, but for many women their 'time of the month' is no joke. Finding suitable feminine care products is difficult even without considering environmental impact. <a target="_blank" href="https://imp.i113075.net/WD2vL3">Rael</a> provides a clean solution. Rael tampons have a core that is made with 100% organic and non-GMO cotton. You can find your perfect fit among three types of applicators made of either BPA-free plastic, plant-based or cardboard materials for easy application and maximum protection. With Rael tampons, you can handle your period without worrying about toxic or irritating chemicals harming you or your environment.</p>
    <p>The same goes for Rael heating patches for cramps. As soon as you apply them, the patches immediately warm up to help you combat cramps and menstrual pain. Infused with lemon balm, juniper berry, jasmine, dandelion root, and rosehip, the patches naturally promote blood flow and reduce discomfort and swelling for up to 6 hours.</p>
    <p>The holistic <a target="_blank" href="https://imp.i113075.net/WD2vL3">period care company</a> now also offers clean skin products that are free from irritating ingredients like synthetic fragrances or dyes, so you can glow all cycle round! "Like your pulse, temperature, breathing rate and blood pressure, periods are one of the most important vital signs when it comes to a woman's overall health. We're on a mission to empower women to incorporate cycle care into their everyday self-care." (<a target="_blank" href="https://imp.i113075.net/WD2vL3">Rael</a>)</p>
    <p>If you're looking to reduce period waste further while having a comfortable and safe period, explore options like a menstrual cup in combination with this fantastic period underwear. Unique solutions for everyone's preferences!</p>

    <p>Although Rael's products are theoretically accessible to anyone with an Internet connection, the reality hits much harder. That's why <a target="_blank" href="https://imp.i113075.net/WD2vL3">Rael</a> teamed up with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hashtaghappyperiod.org/">Happy Period</a>. Together they support women in need in Los Angeles by providing them with menstrual hygiene kits. You can also take part in this action. For every photo shared on Instagram with the hashtag #HappyPeriodsForAll, Rael will donate a period product.</p>
    <p>Rael further works with their partners to provide period education, advocate for menstrual dignity, and distribute feminine essentials to underprivileged women and girls with the goal of cultivating a world where all women can access safe period care.</p>
