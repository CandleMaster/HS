  about: |
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/GjR5K6">Boody</a>’s essentials are so comfy you might not want to take them off anymore. The basics are designed to be worn over and over again and the quality and look of the items definitely help with that.</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/mgoBOy">Bamboo weave</a> regulates temperature and is breathable for extra comfort when hot or cold. It grows without any pesticides, insecticides or fertilizers. It requires only rainwater to grow. And, did you know, bamboo is actually grass? A <i>huge</i> grass that grows so fast that it produces 30% more oxygen compared to an equivalent area of trees while absorbing more CO2 and leading to less erosion (the roots can stay intact when harvesting the grass on top!).</p>
    <p>The level of sustainability of fabric made from bamboo is a <a target="_blank" href="https://ecowarriorprincess.net/2017/10/sustainable-textiles-spotlight-the-truth-behind-bamboo-fabric/">hot topic</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.popsci.com/environment/bamboo-clothing-sustainability-truth/">highly dependent on what process was used</a> to make textile out of the grass. It is therefore important to highlight that Boody’s bamboo yarn is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecocert.com/en">Ecocert</a> certified. Also, all forests that the bamboo is harvested from are FSC-certified for production and supply chain best practices. This means the farming process does not contribute to natural habitat loss. All <a target="_blank" href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/GjR5K6">Boody</a> products are also PETA-Approved (vegan). More certifications like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/">OEKO-TEX</a> and ISO (14001 and 9001) as well as partnerships with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sgs.com.au/">SGS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.intertek.com/">Intertek</a> can help <a target="_blank" href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/GjR5K6">Boody</a> customers rest assured that no harmful chemicals are in contact with their skin, and product are tested for their sustainability and quality at different stages of their production cycle.</p>
