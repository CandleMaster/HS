    <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gladrags.com?aff=95">'Gladrags'</a> reusable panty liners and pads are a solution for several problems that may have not been in front of our minds for a long time. When menstruating, the majority of women would be used to reaching for disposables. However, single-use pads and tampons are neither good for our bodies nor the environment <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3948026/">'source1'</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8462722/">'2'</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/the-ecological-impact-of-feminine-hygiene-products/">'3'</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/the-ecological-impact-of-feminine-hygiene-products/">'4'</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/27/disposable-tampons-arent-sustainable-but-do-women-want-to-talk-about-it">'5'</a>. Single-use pads are in touch with one of the most absorbent parts of our bodies and contain plenty of chemicals (e.g., dyes and bleach). Tampons come with the risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and disturb the vaginal flora.</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gladrags.com?aff=95">'Gladrags'</a>, one of the best reusable period pads, are different: they are made from cotton or organic cotton fiber, thus being gentle on your skin. They are also reusable, i.e. they don’t end up in landfill! That sums up to a lot of waste prevented by each switch! You can even save money when investing in reusables compared to buying disposables, namely $450 over 5 years! </p>
    <p>The reusables are great for postpartum, light incontinence and folks with vulvodynia, vaginitis or allergies as well!

    <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gladrags.com?aff=95">'Gladrags'</a> has been in the business for decades. Right from the start, environmental sustainability and women's health has been driving the company’s operations. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gladrags.com?aff=95">'Gladrags'</a> was B certified and recertified multiple times and achieved high ratings in 2021 including the “Best for Changemakers” tag, proving their continuous effort to benefit people and the planet. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gladrags.com?aff=95">'Gladrags'</a>  actually was one of the pioneers, receiving this certification as the first company in Oregon. Definitely a trend-setter making one of the best reusable period pads!</p>
    <p>The company donates reusable period products and parts of their profit to organizations and/or communities in need to empower women and girls.</p>
    <p>Did you know: one woman uses on average between 12,000 to 16,000 disposable pads, tampons, and pantyliners in a lifetime, each of them wrapped in plastic. This is a lot of landfill that could even potentially end up in our oceans! Each new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gladrags.com?aff=95">'Gladrags'</a> customer helps reduce this burden. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gladrags.com?aff=95">'Gladrags'</a> are not only a solution to the waste problem, but also for providing a safe alternative to the health issues that could accompany disposable period products.</p>
