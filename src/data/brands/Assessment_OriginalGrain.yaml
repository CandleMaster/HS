  about: |
    <p>A timepiece or a piece of time?</p>  
    <p>Made of reclaimed and sustainably sourced <a target="_blank" href="https://shrsl.com/3a6xa">materials that tell a story</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1514455&u=2807031&m=95913&urllink=&afftrack=">Original Grain </a> watches are one-of-a-kind. Whiskey barrels, craft beer barrels, ammunition crates and old stadium seats are just some examples; the company shows that possibilities are endless! Some <a target="_blank" href="https://shrsl.com/3a6xa">collections</a> repurposed military surplus materials, like tent canvas, bomber jackets, and various worn-out camouflage materials. Each piece is carefully and thoroughly crafted to be unique, while looking great when combined with stone-washed stainless steel. In fact, Original Grain watches are designed in-house and then handmade in the US.</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1514455&u=2807031&m=95913&urllink=&afftrack=">Original Grain </a> chooses to traditionally hand craft their sustainable wooden watches rather than using modern methods. This might take more time and effort, however, it means that each piece of wood is used to the maximum, and not a single grain is wasted.</p>

  benefit: |
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1514455&u=2807031&m=95913&urllink=&afftrack=">Original Grain </a> was founded by two brothers that were on a mission to create a completely unique timepiece out of wood and steel. Mission accomplished! Each timepiece the company creates is distinctive so you can find yourself a perfect match and tell a story never told before. A "commitment to authenticity, innovation, and next-level craftsmanship".</p> 
    <p>Together with <a target="_blank" href="https://trees.org/">Trees for the Future</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://onetreeplanted.org/">One Tree Planted</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1514455&u=2807031&m=95913&urllink=&afftrack=">Original Grain </a> is on another mission: reforestation. For each watch sold, a tree is planted to give back to nature, to beautify and to feed the people in the surrounding environment. Around 500,000 trees have been planted to date.</p> 
    <p>"We pride ourselves on being good stewards of the environment."</p> 
    <p>The company is determined to waste no grain, to use every piece of wood to its maximum potential and in turn reduce pressure on extracting new resources. The company's ethos and mission align with the mindset of 'quality over quantity' that we should all embrace more. Own one handcrafted watch that you love over many that break apart in a short amount of time. The 'quality over quantity' philosophy ties in nicely with the 'reduction' component of a sustainable mindset. This is why we love Original Grain's unique work.</p>
